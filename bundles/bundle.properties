block.extension-s-silicon-crucible-ii.name = Large Silicon Crucible
block.extension-s-silicon-crucible-ii.description = A tier 3 silicon smelter, use blast compound for high efficiency.
block.extension-s-multi-press-ii.name = Mass Graphite Press
block.extension-s-multi-press-ii.description = A tier 3 graphite press. Need more water for cooling.
block.extension-metaglass-crucible.name = Metaglass Crucible
block.extension-metaglass-crucible.description = An Advanced Kiln. Use for large metaglass production.
block.extension-metaglass-crucible-ii.name = Large Metaglass Furnace
block.extension-metaglass-crucible-ii.description = Tier 3 kiln. Also use use blast compound.
block.extension-plastanium-compressor-ii.name = Advanced Compressor
block.extension-plastanium-compressor-ii.description = A tier 2 plastanium compressor. Require additional spores for production.
block.extension-plastanium-compressor-iii.name = Large Plastanium Press
block.extension-plastanium-compressor-iii.description = Tier 3 plastanium compressor. Extra metal like leads are needed.
block.extension-phase-weaver-ii.name = Advanced Weaver
block.extension-phase-weaver-ii.description = Tier 2 phase weaver. Require cryofluid as coolant.
block.extension-phase-weaver-iii.name = Large Phase Weaver
block.extension-phase-weaver-iii.description = Tier 3 phase weaver. 
block.extension-surge-smelter-ii.name = Surge Crucible
block.extension-surge-smelter-ii.description = Tier 2 surge smetler. Use Pyratite for heat. Same affinities like silicon crucible
block.extension-surge-smelter-iii.name = Large Surge Crucible
block.extension-surge-smelter-iii.description = Tier 3 surge smetler. Yes it use extra blast compound and coolant
block.extension-surge-smelter-iii.details = WIP sprites
