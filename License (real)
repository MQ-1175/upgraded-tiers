- Don't take my sprite or codes, like why, go make your own stuff.
- Don't even try to make addons or whatever shitty unbalanced addition.
(I simply didn't and will never ask for any of them. After reading countless amount of problems about "someone" making overpowered and game breaking additions for mods that arent theirs, i have to spit this out. If you can not cope with the rules, go shit on other mods.)
Every actions that break the license will be considered stealing
